# S3 - Simple Storage Service

- Object storage, for any type of file.
- Can store a virtual hard disk file (VHD), can be pretty massive in term of GB.
- Differences:
    - Azure have to store our blobs inside of containers.
    - S3 have to store our blobs inside of buckets.
- Advantages of S3:
    - Limitless in how much data can be held.
    - Security: private by default.
    - Accessibility: URL / endpoint provided to access them anywhere.
    - Redundancy: built-in from the start.
- Install aws cli and set up:
    - `sudo pip install awscli`
    - `aws --version`
        
        
    - `alias python=python3`
- `aws configure`:
    - Key:
    - Secret Key:
    - region: eu-west-1
    - format: json
    
    
- To make a bucket:
    - `aws s3 mb s3://<name of bucket>`
    - endpoint starts with s3.
    - `aws s3 ls s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket`
        - gave us no output as empty.
    - Upload file to bucket:
        - `echo This is the first line in a test file > test.txt`
        - `aws s3 cp test.txt s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket`
        - `aws s3 ls s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket` 2024-04-15 10:05:20         38 test.txt
    - Download from bucket to current directory:
        - `aws s3 sync s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket .`
            - Output: download: s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket/test.txt to ./test.txt
        - `ls`
            - Output: test.txt
    - Delete a single file from our bucket:
        - `aws s3 rm s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket/test.txt`
            - You don’t get asked are you sure… be very careful.
    - Delete all files from a bucket:
        - `aws s3 rm s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket --recursive`
- Delete a bucket:
    - `aws s3 rb s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket`
        - Doesn’t work if the bucket isn’t empty.
    - `aws s3 rb s3://tech257-spencer-first-bucket --force`
        - Super Dangerous!!!
        - In md :warning: or :boom: will red flag or explosion next to words so know is dangerous.

# Python Boto3 for CRUD methods
- We can use python to run the crud methods on S3, 
- We need to run the following steps to set up our environment:
  1. `python3 -m venv my_venv`
  2. `source my_venv/bin/activate`
  3. `pip install boto3`
- We're now ready to create our scripts, checkout the scripts in this folder: [Python Scripts for S3 CRUD methods](s3-python-scripts)
